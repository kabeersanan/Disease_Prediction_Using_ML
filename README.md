This project focuses on predicting over 40 diseases based on 132 symptoms using machine learning algorithms. Utilizing a Kaggle-sourced dataset, it implements and compares Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers to determine the most accurate model. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, with performance validated using a confusion matrix. Built using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the project demonstrates effective multi-class classification for healthcare diagnostics and sets the foundation for future integration into user-facing applications.
